- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AudreyJcb!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in too many things : mechanical engineering, informatics, VR & AR, animation movies, CAD (3D modelling), furniture crafting (wood), cooking, drawing/painting, sewing. 
Whatever that makes me learn new things, that includes fun doing it, and that ends up being a great project.
- ðŸŒ± Future projects : a cooking recipes website, and the corresponding app (available on the Playstore).
