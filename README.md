- 👋 Hi, I’m @AudreyJcb!
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things : mechanical engineering, informatics, VR & AR, animation movies, CAD (3D modelling), furniture crafting (wood), cooking, drawing/painting, sewing. 
Whatever that makes me learn new things, that includes fun doing it, and that ends up being a great project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# for Unity3D, to develop my 1st VR app, in an industrial context.
- 💞️ As I just graduated from the INSA HdF engineering school, I’m looking for a 1st job, in northern France, having to do with what I mentionned above.
